Adopt config to print information when functions are started:
TIMELOG;58243;5.61.128.0/18;2_nexthop_check;START
TIMELOG;58243;5.61.128.0/18;2_nexthop_check;END
each line has to start with TIMELOG and values are separated by ;
first value is ASN of peer for which the function was executed.
2nd value is the prefix of the route the filter was applied on
3rd value is the name of the function
4th value indicates if function was started or finished

Collect data with:
sudo journalctl -f -e -o short-iso-precise -u bird@globepeer-ipv4 > data.log


# Add log_time() function to all protocols around RPKI check in BIRD config
This can be done using this search-replace in vim:

:%s/\v(\s*)import_bgp_to_master_1_common\((\d+),([ 0-9,]*)\);\n(\s*)import_bgp_to_master_2_customer_([0-9a-zA-Z_]+)\(\);/\1import_bgp_to_master_1_common\(\2,\3\);\r\1log_time\(\2,net,"i13_rpki_roa",true\);\r\1import_bgp_to_master_2_customer_\5\(\);\r\1log_time\(\2,net,"i13_rpki_roa",false\);/g
